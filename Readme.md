# General Info
Snu Kivy Template is a collection of classes and widgets that make it easier to create theme-able, clean, and a bit flashy apps in Kivy.  Please note that this depends entirely on Kivy, and will not be usable without Kivy installed first.  

This is a gift to the Kivy community, a culmination of what I have learned over the years when developing several kivy-based apps.  Use these classes as a basis for your own, or just use them directly, I impose no limitations on the code or images enclosed in this archive.

To use this template, copy the 'snu' folder to your app directory, and start importing stuff.  See the main.py and test.kv files for examples on how to use the various widgets.  

These widgets mostly depend on the 'NormalApp' class found in 'snu.app.NormalApp'. To use the various widgets, you must make your app a subclass of this, not the basic kivy App class.

Here is a demo of some of the features implemented:
![Demo](demo.gif)  

# snu.app.NormalApp Functionality

This class is a subclass of the 'kivy.app.App' class, it also implements the following features:

## Themes
Two default themes are included in the 'themes' variable, this is simply a list of dictionaries with a specific set of keys.  Copy one of the theme variables and modify the color values to create your own.  

* ### NormalApp.button_scale
Numeric Property, this controlls the overall scale of interface, sane values should be between 50 and 150.  
This value is loaded from the app config file, 'buttonscale'.  
When the config is changed, or when this value is changed, the app will automatically adjust scale.

* ### NormalApp.text_scale
Relative scaling of text, sane values are between 50 and 150.  
This value is loaded from the app config file, 'textscale'.  
When the config is changed, or when this value is changed, the app will automatically adjust scale.

* ### NormalApp.button_divisors
Numeric Property, this defines the number of buttons that will be vertically visible in the window at a button scale of 100%.  This acts as a multiplier for the button_scale variable.  Defaults to 15, make this larger if you want your overall interface to be smaller.  

* ### NormalApp.theme_index
Numeric Property, this defines the index of the theme from the 'themes' variable to be loaded on app creation.  Override this variable in your app to set a different theme index to start with.  

* ### NormalApp.load_theme(Integer)
Load a specific theme index from the themes variable.  This will cause the theme to 'fade' from the current theme.

Tip: Try creating a fully black or fully white theme as the default, then loading your default theme in your on_start for a nice fade-in!

* ### NormalApp.data_to_theme(Dictionary)
Load a theme dictionary as the theme for this app.  Note that if any variables are missing from the dictionary, the current variables will not be changed.  

* ### NormalApp.popup_x
Numeric property that sets the default width in pixels of auto-generated popups. Defaults to 640.

* ### NormalApp.animations
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will disable all animations in the custom widgets.

* ### NormalApp.animation_length
Numeric Property, defaults to 0.2.  This will define the length of the animations in all custom widgets.

* ### NormalApp.clickfade(Widget, mode='opacity')
This function will create a quick colored overlay in the shape and size of the passed-in widget.  This can be used to bring the user's attention to an important widget, or to show that something has been clicked on.  
The 'mode' argument can be set to 'height' to cause the clickfade to fade out by shrinking in height instead of fading out (default behavior).

* ### NormalApp.message(String, timeout=20)
This function will create a user feedback message that will automatically be displayed by all snu.label.InfoLabel widgets.  
This message will blink for a few seconds then vanish.  
Pass in a Float to the timeout variable to change the time this text is displayed.  

* ### NormalApp.clear_message()
This function will instantly clear the app message shown in the InfoLabel widgets.

* ### NormalApp.about()
This function will open a popup that shows the about this app message.  

* ### NormalApp.about_text
String Property, this is the text that will be shown in the popup generated by the about() function shown above.  

* ### NormalApp.message_popup(String, title='Notification')
This function will open a simple message popup that displays the passed in String along with a basic 'OK' button.

* ### NormalApp.set_window_size(load=True)
The NormalApp class will store current window size and position in the config file.  This function can be used to apply the stored window size.  The 'load' argument is a boolean and when set to True will cause the function to first load the stored window size from the config file.  
This can be used in the on_start function to recall the last saved window size:  

    def on_start(self):
        self.set_window_size()


## Crashlog Saving
A couple of helper functions to assist with saving logs for crashes are included.  
To use these functions, you should wrap your main app loop in a try/except like so:

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            MyApp().run()
        except Exception as e:
            try:
                MyApp().save_crashlog()
            except:
                pass
            os._exit(-1)

Please note that by default, this will only save the most recent crash log, and you are responsible for providing the user a method to view/save this log.  

* ### NormalApp.get_crashlog_file()
This function will return the default file location for the crash log.  This should end up saved in the same folder as your app will save it's settings file.  
You can use this function to return the file for saving where the user will have better access to it (or, for instance, to send via email).  
Be warned that this file may not exist yet!

* ### NormalApp.save_crashlog()
This function should be called immediately after the app crashes, it and it will save the kivy log along with any traceback information with the filename returned by get_crashlog_file().

# snu.filebrowser Classes

## snu.filebrowser.FileBrowser
A widget that displays a navigable file browser layout complete with a sidebar for system folders and shortcuts.  Two events are called, on_select and on_cancel when the user clicks the select and cancel buttons.  

Due to the many different uses for a file browser, there are a lot of options available to control the behavior of this widget.  Unfortunately, some of these options can conflict with each other, so here are some examples.  
The default settings are good for opening a single file, just use:

    FileBrowser()

To select a folder to export a pre-defined file, use:

    FileBrowser(file_select=False, folder_select=True, show_files=False, show_filename=False)

To let the user select a folder to export a file that they define, use (note that you should check the 'edited_selected' value, not 'selected'):  

    FileBrowser(edit_filename=True, clear_filename=False, file_select=False, default_filename='default.txt')

* ### FileBrowser.selected
List Property.  This is the files or directories that the dialog selected.  Only the filename will be included, not the full path.  

* ### FileBrowser.edited_selected
String Property.  When edit_filename is enabled, and multi_select is disabled, this variable will be set to the text in the filename input field, allowing the user to provide a custom filename.  

* ### FileBrowser.folder
String Property.  This is the folder that the dialog is currently displaying.  Set this to start in a specific folder, and read it to find out what folder the user ended up in.  

* ### FileBrowser.filetypes_filter
List Property.  This is a list of extensions to display.  Set it to empty to display all files.  This expects standard wildcard style matches, such as:  

    FileBrowser(filetypes_filter=['*.png', '*.jpg'])

* ### FileBrowser.default_filename
String Property.  When the widget is created, the filename field will be set to this value.  This can be used to display the filename that will be written, or to give the user a starting point for a filename.  

* ### FileBrowser.file_select
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  When this is True, the dialog can be used for selecting files.  Note that files will still be displayed by default, unless you hide them.  

* ### FileBrowser.folder_select
Boolean Property, defaults to False.  When this is True, the dialog can be used for selecting folders.  Keep in mind that this will not disable file_select, if you only want to select folders please disable that variable.  

* ### FileBrowser.multi_select
Boolean Property, defaults to False.  Setting this to True allows multiple files to be selected.  Clicking a file will toggle selection, and a range of files can be selected with shift-click.  Please note that only one folder may be selected, even if this is set to True.  

* ### FileBrowser.show_files
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Display files in the browser.  Setting this to False will result in only folders being shown.  

* ### FileBrowser.require_filename
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  When this is True, the select button cannot be clicked if no file or folder is selected or provided.  

* ### FileBrowser.edit_filename
Boolean Property, defaults to False.  Setting this to True allows the user to enter a filename manually, or to edit existing filenames.  This can only be used when multi_select is disabled.  The edited filename will be stored in the variable 'edited_selected', be sure to check this if you wish to use the user's edit.  
Be warned: enabling this may result in the 'selected' variable being empty, and only the 'edited_selected' variable containing a valid value.  

* ### FileBrowser.clear_filename
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  When this is True, the filename will be cleared when in file select mode and the folder is changed.  

* ### FileBrowser.autoselect_files
Boolean Property, defaults to False.  Setting this to True will cause all files to be selected in the folder when each folder is opened.  This variable only works when multi_select is enabled.  

* ### FileBrowser.cancel_text
String Property, defaults to 'Cancel'.  This is the text shown on the cancel button.  

* ### FileBrowser.select_text
String Property, defaults to 'Select'.  This is the text shown on the confirm or ok button.  

* ### FileBrowser.shortcuts_size
Numeric Property, defaults to 0.5.  This is the size_hint_x variable for the shortcuts area on the right side, also controls the width of the ok and cancel buttons.   
 
* ### FileBrowser.show_cancel
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will hide the cancel button.  Hide this if you have a different method for canceling the file selection.  

* ### FileBrowser.show_select
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will hide the ok button.  Hide this if you have a different way of confirming a file selection.  

* ### FileBrowser.show_folder_edit
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will hide the new folder and delete folder buttons.  Hide these if you do not want the user to modify the folder structure.  

* ### FileBrowser.show_filename
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will hide the selected filename field.  This may be useful to hide for export dialogs, or for folder selection dialogs.  


* ### FileBrowser.
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to
