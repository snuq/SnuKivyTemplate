# General Info
Snu Kivy Template is a collection of classes and widgets that make it easier to create theme-able, clean, and a bit flashy apps in Kivy.  Please note that this depends entirely on Kivy, and will not be usable without Kivy installed first.  

This is a gift to the Kivy community, a culmination of what I have learned over the years when developing several kivy-based apps.  Use these classes as a basis for your own, or just use them directly, I impose no limitations on the code or images enclosed in this archive.

To use this template, copy the 'snu' folder to your app directory, and start importing stuff.  See the main.py and test.kv files for examples on how to use the various widgets.  

These widgets mostly depend on the 'NormalApp' class found in 'snu.app.NormalApp'. To use the various widgets, you must make your app a subclass of this, not the basic kivy App class.

Here is a demo of some of the features implemented:

# snu.app.NormalApp Functionality

This class is a subclass of the 'kivy.app.App' class, it also implements the following features:

## Themes
Two default themes are included in the 'themes' variable, this is simply a list of dictionaries with a specific set of keys.  Copy one of the theme variables and modify the color values to create your own.  

* ### NormalApp.button_scale
Numeric Property, this controlls the overall scale of interface, sane values should be between 50 and 150.  
This value is loaded from the app config file, 'buttonscale'.  
When the config is changed, or when this value is changed, the app will automatically adjust scale.

* ### NormalApp.text_scale
Relative scaling of text, sane values are between 50 and 150.  
This value is loaded from the app config file, 'textscale'.  
When the config is changed, or when this value is changed, the app will automatically adjust scale.

* ### NormalApp.button_divisors
Numeric Property, this defines the number of buttons that will be vertically visible in the window at a button scale of 100%.  This acts as a multiplier for the button_scale variable.  Defaults to 15, make this larger if you want your overall interface to be smaller.  

* ### NormalApp.theme_index
Numeric Property, this defines the index of the theme from the 'themes' variable to be loaded on app creation.  Override this variable in your app to set a different theme index to start with.  

* ### NormalApp.load_theme(Integer)
Load a specific theme index from the themes variable.  This will cause the theme to 'fade' from the current theme.

Tip: Try creating a fully black or fully white theme as the default, then loading your default theme in your on_start for a nice fade-in!

* ### NormalApp.data_to_theme(Dictionary)
Load a theme dictionary as the theme for this app.  Note that if any variables are missing from the dictionary, the current variables will not be changed.  

* ### NormalApp.popup_x
Numeric property that sets the default width in pixels of auto-generated popups. Defaults to 640.

* ### NormalApp.animations
Boolean Property, defaults to True.  Setting this to False will disable all animations in the custom widgets.

* ### NormalApp.animation_length
Numeric Property, defaults to 0.2.  This will define the length of the animations in all custom widgets.

* ### NormalApp.clickfade(Widget, mode='opacity')
This function will create a quick colored overlay in the shape and size of the passed-in widget.  This can be used to bring the user's attention to an important widget, or to show that something has been clicked on.  
The 'mode' argument can be set to 'height' to cause the clickfade to fade out by shrinking in height instead of fading out (default behavior).

* ### NormalApp.message(String, timeout=20)
This function will create a user feedback message that will automatically be displayed by all snu.label.InfoLabel widgets.  
This message will blink for a few seconds then vanish.  
Pass in a Float to the timeout variable to change the time this text is displayed.  

* ### NormalApp.clear_message()
This function will instantly clear the app message shown in the InfoLabel widgets.

* ### NormalApp.about()
This function will open a popup that shows the about this app message.  

* ### NormalApp.about_text
String Property, this is the text that will be shown in the popup generated by the about() function shown above.  

* ### NormalApp.message_popup(String, title='Notification')
This function will open a simple message popup that displays the passed in String along with a basic 'OK' button.

* ### NormalApp.set_window_size(load=True)
The NormalApp class will store current window size and position in the config file.  This function can be used to apply the stored window size.  The 'load' argument is a boolean and when set to True will cause the function to first load the stored window size from the config file.  
This can be used in the on_start function to recall the last saved window size:  

    def on_start(self):
        self.set_window_size()
